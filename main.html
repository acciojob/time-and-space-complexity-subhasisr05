	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity: A Guide to Analyzing Algorithm Performance</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of how the runtime of an 
		algorithm or program grows as the input size increases. 
		It's a fundamental concept in computer science that helps in understanding the efficiency of algorithms. 
		A key aspect of time complexity is analyzing how the number of operations performed by an algorithm scales with the size of the input. 
		Efficient time complexity implies that an algorithm can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time it takes to execute. 
		By assessing time complexity, developers can make informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization, 
		ultimately improving the performance of their software systems.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a crucial metric in algorithm analysis, measuring the amount of memory an algorithm consumes as a function of the input size. It evaluates how additional memory requirements grow with larger inputs. Denoted typically by <b>O(n)</b> , where 'n' represents the size of the input, <b>space complexity</b>  considers the variables, data structures, and other memory allocations utilized during the execution of an algorithm. An algorithm with a <b>space complexity</b>  of <b>O(n)</b>  indicates that its memory usage increases linearly with the size of the input. Understanding <b>space complexity</b>  is vital for designing efficient algorithms, especially in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems or when dealing with large datasets where minimizing memory consumption is paramount for optimal performance.</p>
