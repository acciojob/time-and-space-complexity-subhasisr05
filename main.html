	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science, quantifying the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run based on the length of the input. It is expressed using big O notation, where lower complexities, such as O(log n) or O(n), are considered more efficient than higher ones like O(n^2) or O(2^n). Efficient algorithms strive to strike a balance between solving a problem accurately and doing so in a time-efficient manner.

        Space Complexity is another vital aspect, focusing on the amount of memory space an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. It is denoted as O(f(n)), where f(n) represents the function describing the space required concerning the input size, n. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity indicates linear growth in memory usage relative to the input size. Notably, <b>Space Complexity</b> is a key consideration in algorithm design, especially in scenarios with limited resources or when dealing with extensive datasets.
